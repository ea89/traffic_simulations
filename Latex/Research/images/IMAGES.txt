graph1.jpg: This graph shows how changing the relative ratio can affect the parking success rate. For this graph, the following specs were used:
lambda = 0.1;
mun = 0.005;
mud = 0.5;
p = 0.8;
Nt = 20;
L = 30;
d = 0.8;



graph3.eps: 
lambda = 0.5;
mun = 0.1;
mud = 0.001;
p = 0.4;
L = 50;
d = 0.1;
N = [5, 30, 50];
